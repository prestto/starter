# Starter

This project is to help understand how to use a simple web server.

It relies on docker/ docker compose, this ensures that the dependencies are maintained, and that the project is compatible across windows and ubuntu etc.

To download docker compose, go here:
- [windows](https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/)
- [ubuntu](https://docs.docker.com/install/linux/docker-ce/ubuntu/)

I also recommend using vscode.  That can be found [here](https://code.visualstudio.com/download)
